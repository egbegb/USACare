USACare for All American Citizens

   A LAW WHERE THE US GOVERNMENT EMPOWERS
   ALL CITIZENS TO HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH
   CARE IMMEDIATELY

Statement of USAcare for American Citizens:

      ALL CITIZENS ARE EMPOWERED BY
      THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF
      THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
      GOVERNMENT TO SEEK THE
      PROVIDER OF THEIR CHOICE FOR
      THE HEALTH CARE OF THEIR
      CHOICE, RECEIVE THAT HEALTH
      CARE SERVICE, AND PAY IN
      CASH AT THE POINT OF SERVICE,
      ALL OF TODAY'S FEDERAL LAWS
      AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS
      NOTWITHSTANDING.  

Here is one way to accomplish
this mission.

1. All American citizens always
   contribute the lessor of X% of
   pre-tax income or Y dollars
   into their own personally
   owned FDIC insured Health
   Savings Account (HSA) or gift
   that money to the federal
   government via taxation.
   The law says

        *Contribute to YOUR HSA
         or give your money to
         the federal government
         -- YOUR CHOICE*.

   (Guess: X = 8%, Y = $15000 --
      poor pay X, rich pay Y)

2. All 330,000,000 Americans can go to
   the provider of their choice for the
   reasons of their choice, receive
   service, and pay the provider with
   a check drawn from their personal
   HSA account on the way out of the
   office the very day USACare is
   signed into law (or shortly
   thereafter).

3. The full faith and credit of the
   United States Government stands
   behind every HSA in America. All
   overdrafts of all 330,000,000
   HSA's without qualification are
   covered by the United States of
   America's full faith and credit.
   All withdrawals from HSA's must
   be for health care or the money
   is taxed 100% or more.

4. HSA's are owned and can be willed
   to descendants.  Upon death, they
   convert to cash for the estate of
   the deceased and the cash is
   untaxed in any way.

5. New drugs can be introduced at
   any price.  Revenue from price
   increases beyond the cost of
   living index can be subject
   to a tax.

     [#5 is not an excellent solution
      to high drug prices. It is a
      first guess. What must also
      be considered is the
      contributions of all of the
      investors in the production
      of a new miracle drug. To
      date, that has not been done.
      This item needs more thought]

6. The HSA covers contact lenses,
   Lasik, dental, cosmetic and
   anything the patient and the
   medical community (not the
   government) declares to be
   medical.


To simplify the passage of a law
like this, words to the effect
saying:

    All federal rules, regulations,
    and laws that conflict with
    this law, notwithstanding. The
    federal government has only
    this law as ultimate health
    care authority.

would be added to the bill, along
with the obligatory "any taxing
power necessary to enforce this
law can be passed".
